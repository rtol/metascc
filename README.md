https://ideas.repec.org/p/sus/susewp/7515.html (socialcostcarbon-REEP.xlsx) and Tol (2021) https://ideas.repec.org/p/sus/susewp/0821.html (socialcostcarbonNCC.xlsx).

KernelWrapper.m runs the scripts in the right order for the paper in Nature Climate Change https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-023-01680-x.

The latest version of the data is always socialcostcarbon.xlsx
